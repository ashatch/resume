## Senior Software Engineer & Team Lead, Amplience

* September 2015 – present.
* Amplience is a headless content SaaS platform with tier-1
retailers and well known brands as customers.

Led a team in a multi-team project to build a service-oriented
content management system (_Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, AWS, MongoDB,
Elasticsearch, Kinesis_).
Iterative development though to 10 million requests/day.
Delivered on-time with a low defect-rate.

Developed a <30ms low latency, multi-region content
delivery API using Anycast networks, CDNs and containers. Built
with a multi-reactive framework (vert.x, RxJava) for
high performance non-blocking IO. Currently serving
~12 million graphs day. Push-button CI/CD deployment using
AWS CDK infrastructure-as-code.

Ran two projects to deliver an upgrade path
for Cassandra (NoSQL db) and Solr (text search index) allowing
for horizontal scalability to much larger cluster sizes. Allowed
growth to manage billions of documents. Used dual-write strategies
with blue/green switch-over.

Built an asynchronous publishing service orchestrated by
a state machine (AWS Step Functions) using serverless Lambdas and
DynamoDB with integration to a legacy AWS Simple Workflow system.
Orchestrated using AWS CDK.

Led a team to diagnose and protect an internet-facing API from
DDoS-like traffic spikes using a token-bucket rate limiting
layer using AWS API Gateway, Cloudfront and WAF.
Significantly reduced incident rates.

Ran a mini project to reduce development costs. Optimised
AWS resource use to bring down expenditure by 30%.
Migrated projects to containers (AWS ECS/Docker) allowing
migration to AWS Fargate. Built tooling (Lambdas) to scale development environments.
